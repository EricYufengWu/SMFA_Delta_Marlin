## Usage
1. With the latest Arduino IDE installed, navigate to the "Marlin" subfolder and open the file "marlin.ino".
1. Make sure you have the correct board info and ports selected, and upload to the Arduino Mega running the firmware (for extra caution, do not connect the arduino to your computer while the printer is powered on).
1. On the top bar in Arduino IDE, navigate to "configurations.h" and make changes if needed. Refer to the Marlin community for more help.
